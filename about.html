                  <h6>Hello, I'm Joseph. I've graduated with a diploma on Infocomn and Security at Nanyang Polytechnic. 
                  I would love to study Information Technology as I have a keen interest in the digital field. My Interest first took place when I was in Polytechnic, and was first introduced to cyber security, as well as programming. I find It interesting to become a cyber security specialist and be the one to block and defend against attacks. I also have an interest in being able to 
                  develop applications and websites as I find It nice to be able to understand the set of codes and use it to create something of my own.
